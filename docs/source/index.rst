Welcome to pyCUFSM's documentation!
===================================

**pyCUFSM** is primarily a Python port - and improvement - upon `CUFSM v5.05 <https://www.ce.jhu.edu/cufsm/>`_ - Constrained and Unconstrained Finite Strip Method. CUFSM was written by Benjamin Schafer PhD et al at Johns Hopkins University. The goal of this project is to create a derivative of CUFSM which can be used either in Jupyter Notebooks or in headless (library) applications. This project is not affiliated with Benjamin Schafer PhD or Johns Hopkins University in any way.

This program is capable of analysing arbitrary cross-sections of any material in any unit system, and producing the signature curves necessary for determining all parameters needed in the Direct Strength Method, as is either required or optionally usable in many design standards internationally for cold-formed steel, aluminium, stainless steel, and some other thin-walled metals.

   This project is under active development.
